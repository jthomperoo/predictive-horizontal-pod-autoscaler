# Models

## Shared Configuration

All models share these properties:

- **type** - The type of the model, for example 'Linear'.
- **name** - The name of the model, must be unique and not shared by multiple models.
- **perSyncPeriod** - The frequency that the model is used to recalculate and store values - tied to the sync period as
a base unit, with a value of `1` resulting in the model being recalculated every sync period, a value of `2` meaning
recalculated every other sync period, `3` waits for two sync periods after every calculation and so on.
- **calculationTimeout** - The timeout for calculating using an algorithm, if this timeout is exceeded the calculation
is skipped. Defaults set based on the algorithm used, see below.
- **startInterval** - The [duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) that the model should start to apply from.
For example a value of `1m` would mean the model would only start to apply at the top of the next minute. This is
useful if you have seasonal data that you need the model synced to, such as Holt-Winters, which allows you to do things
like making sure the model defines the start of a Holt-Winters season as starting at midnight (with the season being)
the whole day.
- **resetDuration** - The [duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) that the model can go for without recording
any data before the data is too old and is cleared out. A new start time will be calculated from the `startInterval`
if it's provided at this point too.

All models use `syncPeriod` as a base unit, so if the sync period is defined as `10000` (10 seconds), the models will
base their timings and calculations as multiples of 10 seconds.

## Linear Regression

The linear regression model uses a default calculation timeout of `30000` (30 seconds).

Example:
```yaml
models:
  - type: Linear
    name: simple-linear
    perSyncPeriod: 1
    calculationTimeout: 25000
    linear:
      lookAhead: 10000
      historySize: 6
```
The **linear** component of the configuration handles configuration of the Linear regression options:

- **lookAhead** - sets up the model to try to predict `10 seconds` ahead of time (time in milliseconds).
- **historySize** - sets up the model to store the past `6` evaluations and to use these for predictions. If there
are `> 6` evaluations, the oldest will be removed.

For a more detailed example, [see the example in
`/examples/simple-linear`](https://github.com/jthomperoo/predictive-horizontal-pod-autoscaler/tree/master/examples/simple-linear).

## Holt-Winters Time Series prediction

The Holt-Winters time series model uses a default calculation timeout of `30000` (30 seconds).

Example:
```yaml
models:
- type: HoltWinters
  name: simple-holt-winters
  perSyncPeriod: 1
  startInterval: 60s
  startIntervalResetDuration: 5m
  holtWinters:
    alpha: 0.9
    beta: 0.9
    gamma: 0.9
    seasonalPeriods: 6
    storedSeasons: 4
    trend: additive
    seasonal: additive
```

The **holtWinters** component of the configuration handles configuration of the Linear regression options:

- **alpha**, **beta**, **gamma** - these are the smoothing coefficients for level, trend and seasonality respectively,
requires tweaking and analysis to be able to optimise. See [here](https://github.com/jthomperoo/holtwinters) or
[here](https://grisha.org/blog/2016/01/29/triple-exponential-smoothing-forecasting/) for more details.
- **seasonalPeriods** - the length of a season in base unit sync periods, for example if your sync period was `10000`
(10 seconds), and your repeated season was 60 seconds long, this value would be `6`.
- **storedSeasons** - the number of seasons to store, for example `4`, if there are `>4` seasons stored, the oldest
season will be removed.
- **trend** - Either `add`/`additive` or `mul`/`multiplicative`, defines the method for the trend element.
- **seasonal** - Either `add`/`additive` or `mul`/`multiplicative`, defines the method for the seasonal element.

This is the model in action, taken from the `simple-holt-winters` example:
![Predicted values overestimating but still fitting actual values](../img/holt_winters_prediction_vs_actual.svg)
The red value is the predicted values, the blue value is the actual values. From this you can see that the prediction
is overestimating, but still pre-emptively scaling - storing more seasons and adjusting alpha, beta and gamma values
would reduce the overestimation and produce more accurate results.

For a more detailed example, [see the example in
`/examples/simple-holt-winters`](https://github.com/jthomperoo/predictive-horizontal-pod-autoscaler/tree/master/examples/simple-holt-winters).

### Advanced tuning

There are more configuration options for the Holt-Winters algorithm, which in this project uses the
[statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/) Python package. These are the additional configuration options, which are
documented by the [Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing statsmodels
documentation](https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/generated/statsmodels.tsa.holtwinters.ExponentialSmoothing.html) - the
names of the variables in this documentation map to the camelcase names described here.

- **dampedTrend** - Boolean value to determine if the trend should be damped.
- **initializationMethod** - Which initialization method to use, see statsmodels for details, either `estimated`,
`heuristic`, `known`, or `legacy-heuristic`
- **initialLevel** - The initial level value, required if `initializationMethod` is `known`.
- **initialTrend** - The initial trend value, required if `initializationMethod` is `known`.
- **initialSeasonal** - The initial seasonal value, required if `initializationMethod` is `known`.

### Holt-Winters Runtime Tuning

The PHPA supports dynamically fetching the tuning values for the Holt-Winters algorithm (`alpha`, `beta`, and `gamma`).

This is done using a `hook` system, to see more information of how the dynamic hook system works [visit the hooks
user guide](./hooks.md)

For example, a hook using a HTTP request to fetch the values of runtime is configured as:

```yaml
models:
- type: HoltWinters
  name: simple-holt-winters
  perSyncPeriod: 1
  startInterval: 60s
  startIntervalResetDuration: 5m
  holtWinters:
    runtimeTuningFetchHook:
      type: "http"
      timeout: 2500
      http:
        method: "GET"
        url: "http://tuning/holt_winters"
        successCodes:
          - 200
        parameterMode: query
    seasonalPeriods: 6
    storedSeasons: 4
    trend: additive
    seasonal: additive
```

The hook is defined with the name `runtimeTuningFetchHook`.

The supported hook types for the PHPA are:

- HTTP requests

The process is as follows:

1. PHPA begins Holt-Winters calculation.
2. The values are initially set to any hardcoded values supplied in the configuration.
3. A runtime tuning configuration has been supplied, using this configuration a hook is executed (for example a HTTP
request is sent).
  - This hook will provide as input data in JSON that includes the current model, and an array of timestamped
  previous scaling decisions (referred to as `evaluations`, [see below](#request-format)).
  - The response should conform to the expected JSON structure ([see below](#response-format)).
4. If the hook execution is successful, and the response is valid, the tuning values are extracted and any provided
values overwrite the hardcoded values.
5. If all required tuning values are provided the tuning values are used to calculate.

The tuning values can be both hardcoded and fetched at runtime, for example the `alpha` value could be calculated at
runtime, and the `beta` and `gamma` values could be hardcoded in configuration:

```yaml
models:
- type: HoltWinters
  name: simple-holt-winters
  perSyncPeriod: 1
  holtWinters:
    runtimeTuningFetchHook:
      type: "http"
      timeout: 2500
      http:
        method: "GET"
        url: "http://tuning/holt_winters"
        successCodes:
          - 200
        parameterMode: query
    beta: 0.9
    gamma: 0.9
    seasonalPeriods: 6
    storedSeasons: 4
    trend: additive
    seasonal: additive
```

Or the values could be provided, and if they are not returned by the external source the hardcoded values will be used
as a backup:

```yaml
models:
- type: HoltWinters
  name: simple-holt-winters
  perSyncPeriod: 1
  holtWinters:
    runtimeTuningFetchHook:
      type: "http"
      timeout: 2500
      http:
        method: "GET"
        url: "http://tuning/holt_winters"
        successCodes:
          - 200
        parameterMode: query
    alpha: 0.9
    beta: 0.9
    gamma: 0.9
    seasonalPeriods: 6
    storedSeasons: 4
    trend: additive
    seasonal: additive
```

If any value is missing, the PHPA will report it as an error (e.g.
`No alpha tuning value provided for Holt-Winters prediction`) and not calculate and scale.

#### Request Format

The data that the external source will recieve will be formatted as:

```json
{
  "model": {
    "type": "HoltWinters",
    "name": "HoltWintersPrediction",
    "perInterval": 1,
    "linear": null,
    "holtWinters": {
      "alpha": null,
      "beta": null,
      "gamma": null,
      "runtimeTuningFetchHook": {
        "type": "http",
        "timeout": 2500,
        "shell": null,
        "http": {
          "method": "GET",
          "url": "http://tuning/holt_winters",
          "successCodes": [
            200
          ],
          "parameterMode": "query"
        }
      },
      "seasonalPeriods": 6,
      "storedSeasons": 4,
      "trend": "additive"
    }
  },
  "replicaHistory": [
    {
      "time": "2020-10-19T19:12:20Z",
      "replicas": 0
    },
    {
      "time": "2020-10-19T19:12:40Z",
      "replicas": 0
    },
    {
      "time": "2020-10-19T19:13:00Z",
      "replicas": 0
    },
  ]
}
```

This provides information around the model being used, how it is configured, and previous replica values
(`replicaHistory`). This data could be used to help calculate the tuning values, or it could be ignored.

#### Response Format

The response that the external tuning source should return must be in JSON, and in the following format:

```json
{
  "alpha": <alpha_value>,
  "beta": <beta_value>,
  "gamma": <gamma_value>
}
```

This is a simple JSON structure, for example:

```json
{
  "alpha": 0.9,
  "beta": 0.6,
  "gamma": 0.8
}
```

Each of these values is optional, for example perhaps only the `alpha` and `beta` should be runtime, and `gamma` should
rely on the hardcoded configuration value, this response would be valid:

```json
{
  "alpha": 0.9,
  "beta": 0.6
}
```

`/examples/dynamic-holt-winters`](https://github.com/jthomperoo/predictive-horizontal-pod-autoscaler/tree/master/examples/dynamic-holt-winters).
