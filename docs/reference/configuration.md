# Configuration

Predictive Horizontal Pod Autoscalers have a number of configuration options available.

## minReplicas

```yaml
minReplicas: 2
```

The lower limit for the number of replicas to which the autoscaler can scale down to. `minReplicas` is allowed to be 0
if at least one Object or External metric is configured. Scaling is active as long as at least one metric value is
available.

Default value: `1`.

## maxReplicas

```yaml
maxReplicas: 15
```

The upper limit for the number of replicas to which the autoscaler can scale up.
It cannot be less than minReplicas.

Default value: `10`.

## syncPeriod

```yaml
syncPeriod: 10000
```

Equivalent to `--horizontal-pod-autoscaler-sync-period`; the frequency with which the PHPA calculates replica counts and
scales in milliseconds.

Set in milliseconds.

Default value: `15000` (15 seconds).

Set in milliseconds.

## downscaleStabilization

```yaml
downscaleStabilization: 150
```

Equivalent to `--horizontal-pod-autoscaler-downscale-stabilization`; the length of the downscale stabilization window.
Downscale stabilization works by recording all evaluations over the window specified and picking out the maximum target
replicas from these evaluations. This results in a more smoothed downscaling and a cooldown, which can reduce the
effect of thrashing.

Set in seconds.

Default value: `300` (5 minutes).

## cpuInitializationPeriod

```yaml
cpuInitializationPeriod: 150
```

Equivalent to `--horizontal-pod-autoscaler-cpu-initialization-period`; the period after pod start when CPU samples
might be skipped.

Set in seconds.

Default value: `300` (5 minutes).

## initialReadinessDelay

```yaml
initialReadinessDelay: 45
```

Equivalent to `--horizontal-pod-autoscaler-initial-readiness-delay`; the period after pod start during which readiness
changes will be treated as initial readiness.

Set in seconds.

Default value: `30` (30 seconds).

## tolerance

```yaml
tolerance: 0.25
```

Equivalent to `--horizontal-pod-autoscaler-tolerance`; the minimum change (from 1.0) in the desired-to-actual metrics
ratio for the horizontal pod autoscaler to consider scaling.

Default value: `0.1`.

## decisionType

```yaml
decisionType: mean
```

Decider on which evaluation to pick if there are multiple models provided.

Possible values:

- **maximum** - pick the highest evaluation of the models.
- **minimum** - pick the lowest evaluation of the models.
- **mean** - calculate the mean number of replicas (rounded to nearest integer) between the models.
- **median** - calculate the median number of replicas between the models.

Default value: `maximum`.
