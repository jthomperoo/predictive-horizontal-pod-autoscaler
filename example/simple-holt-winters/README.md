# Simple Holt-Winters Example

## Overview

This example is showing a predictive horizontal pod autoscaler using holt-winters exponential smoothing time series prediction, with no persistent storage, so if the scaler is deleted the data will not persist.  

## Usage
If you want to deploy this onto your cluster, you first need to install the [Custom Pod Autoscaler Operator](https://github.com/jthomperoo/custom-pod-autoscaler-operator), follow the [installation guide for instructions for installing the operator](https://github.com/jthomperoo/custom-pod-autoscaler-operator/blob/master/INSTALL.md).  

This example was based on the [Horizontal Pod Autoscaler Walkthrough](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale-walkthrough/).

1. Use `kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml` to spin up the app/deployment to manage, called `php-apache`.
2. Use `kubectl apply -f phpa.yaml` to start the autoscaler, pointing at the previously created deployment.
3. Use `kubectl logs simple-linear-example --follow` to see the autoscaler working and the log output it produces.
4. Increase the load with: `kubectl run --generator=run-pod/v1 -it --rm load-generator --image=busybox /bin/sh`
    * Once it has loaded, run this command to create load `while true; do wget -q -O- http://php-apache.default.svc.cluster.local; done`
5. Watch as the number of replicas increases.
6. Use `kubectl exec -it simple-linear-example sqlite3 /store/predictive-horizontal-pod-autoscaler.db 'SELECT * FROM evaluation;'` to see the evaluations stored locally and tracked by the autoscaler.

## Explained

The example has some configuration
```yaml
config: 
  - name: minReplicas
    value: "1"
  - name: maxReplicas
    value: "5"
  - name: metrics
    value: |
    - type: Resource
        resource:
        name: cpu
        target:
            type: Utilization
            averageUtilization: 50
  - name: predictiveConfig
    value: |
      models:
      - type: HoltWinters
        name: HoltWintersPrediction
        perInterval: 1
        holtWinters:
          alpha: 0.9
          beta: 0.9
          gamma: 0.9
          seasonLength: 5
          storedSeasons: 2
      decisionType: "maximum"
  - name: interval
    value: "60000"
```
The `minReplicas`, `maxReplicas` and `interval` are Custom Pod Autoscaler options, setting minimum and maximum replicas, and the time interval inbetween each autoscale being run, i.e. the autoscaler checks every 10 seconds.  
The `metrics` option is a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler option, targeting CPU utilisation.  
The `predictiveConfig` option is the Predictive Horizontal Pod Autoscaler options, detailing a linear regression model that runs on every interval, looking 10 seconds ahead, keeping track of the past 6 replica values in order to predict the next result, and the `decisionType` is maximum, which if there were multiple models provided would mean that the PHPA would use the one with the highest replica count; there are two other options, `mean` and `minimum`.
